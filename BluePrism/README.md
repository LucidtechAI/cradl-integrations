# Asset Pitch
Boost Blue Prism with Crad AI: State of the art document parsing powered by the latest within machine learning.

# About the offer
Build cutting edge AI models for document parsing and seamlessly integrate into your existing workflows in Blue Prism. 
Instead of relying on pre-trained models that almost fit your case, Cradl AI enables you to train your own model on your own documents. 
Our ML models are language agnostic and designed to be easily trained on any document type across industries. 
With as little as 15 examples our deep neural network is able to adapt to your documents and provide you with the output that you need to automate your document process. 
Cradl AI offers an all-in-one AI platform that enables automated document parsing as well as an optional human-in-the-loop approach for superior accuracy and adaptability.

Actions included in this Asset:

Parse Document:  Extract line items and key-value information from your document as defined in your model. 

Parse Document with Human-in-the-Loop: Allow users to verify output from the model before it is returned. This is the easiest way to create more data for training your model.

Cradl Demo Process: Example process that illustrates how to retrieve the output from Cradl AI.
